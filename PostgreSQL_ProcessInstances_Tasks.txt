-- IMPORTANT: Be aware that some SQL statements require additional libraries
--            Where needed this is mentioned before the statement

-- Provides statistics information 

-- Base statistics data:
select schemaname, relname, seq_scan, idx_scan, n_live_tup, n_mod_since_analyze, n_ins_since_vacuum, last_vacuum, last_autovacuum, last_analyze from pg_stat_all_tables ;


-- Most expensive SQL statements
-- Requirements: In postgresql.conf (restart required):   shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_statements' 
                 Use select pg_stat_statements_reset() to reset the counters

-- Table scan activities:
SELECT schemaname, relname, seq_scan, seq_tup_read, idx_scan, seq_tup_read / seq_scan AS avg FROM pg_stat_user_tables WHERE seq_scan > 0 ORDER BY seq_tup_read DESC ;
